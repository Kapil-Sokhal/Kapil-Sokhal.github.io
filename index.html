      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello!  I am a passionate Physics graduate with a strong focus on Condensed Matter Physics. I carried out a research project on “Spectroscopic Studies of Eu-Doped Calcium Tungstate Crystal,” analyzing its structural and optical properties.I have actively participated in workshops, symposiums, and certification courses to enhance my understanding of quantum materials, superconductivity, and emergent phenomena. <p>
      <p> I am committed to advancing the field of Condensed Matter Physics through both theoretical and experimental approaches. As I prepare to pursue a Ph.D., my goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research in this field, focusing on computational analysis, theoretical modeling, and experimental techniques.
I am deeply motivated by the transformative potential of condensed matter physics to address fundamental challenges in quantum materials, superconductivity, and emergent phenomena, while driving innovation in energy technologies and quantum computing..</p>
